2 + 3


# if you have multiple operations in a cell, only the last expression will be printed
4 + 5
5 * 5


# if you want to the other stuff to appear, you need to use print() commands
print(4 + 5)

# note that when you do this, there is no Out[ ] for the cell.





In[1]


Out[2]


# Out is a dictionary
Out


# In is a list

# multiplication repeats the string
3 * 'hello!'


# addition concatenates strings
